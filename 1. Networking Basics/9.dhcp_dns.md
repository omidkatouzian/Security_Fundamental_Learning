# 📡 DHCP / DNS – Essential Network Services

## 🧠 What is DHCP?

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a network protocol used to **automatically assign IP addresses** and other network configuration settings to devices on a network.

---

## 🔄 How DHCP Works

When a device connects to a network:

1. It sends a **DHCP Discover** message.
2. The **DHCP server** replies with an **Offer** (includes IP, gateway, DNS).
3. The device **Requests** the offered IP.
4. The server sends an **Acknowledgement** (ACK).

### ✅ Example:
Your laptop joins Wi-Fi → DHCP gives it:
- IP: `192.168.1.10`
- Subnet: `255.255.255.0`
- Gateway: `192.168.1.1`
- DNS: `8.8.8.8`

## 🔧 DHCP Components

| Component         | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| DHCP Server       | Assigns IP addresses               |
| DHCP Client       | Receives configuration             |
| IP Address Pool   | Range of IPs DHCP can assign       |
| Lease Time        | How long a device keeps an IP      |

## 🌍 What is DNS?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** translates **human-readable domain names** (like `www.google.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `142.250.190.14`).

It’s like the **phonebook** of the internet.

---

## 🔍 Why DNS Matters

- Humans remember **names**, not IPs.
- Websites are hosted on servers identified by **IP addresses**.
- DNS connects the two.

---

## 🌐 How DNS Works

1. You type `www.example.com` in your browser.
2. Your device asks the **DNS server** for the IP.
3. DNS returns `93.184.216.34`.
4. Your browser connects to that IP to load the website.

## 🛠️ Types of DNS Records

| Record Type | Purpose                             | Example                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| A           | Maps domain to IPv4 address         | `example.com → 93.184.216.34` |
| AAAA        | Maps domain to IPv6 address         | `example.com → ::1`           |
| MX          | Mail server info                    | `mail.example.com`            |
| CNAME       | Alias for another domain            | `www → example.com`           |
| NS          | Nameservers for the domain          | `ns1.example.com`             |

## 🔗 DHCP vs DNS

| Feature           | DHCP                                | DNS                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Role              | Assigns IPs to devices               | Resolves domain names to IPs        |
| Works At          | Device joining a network             | When accessing websites/services    |
| Type              | Configuration Protocol               | Name Resolution Protocol            |
| Common Use        | Giving your laptop an IP address     | Loading websites like google.com    |

## ✅ Summary

- **DHCP** automatically gives IP settings to devices.
- **DNS** translates domain names into IP addresses.
- Both are **critical for everyday internet use**.

> DHCP tells your device *who it is*; DNS tells it *where to go*.
