# What is a Network? (LAN/WAN/MAN)

## 🌐 Introduction to Network

A **network** is a group of two or more devices (like computers, smartphones, printers, servers) that are connected together to share information, data, resources, or services.

The goal of networking is **communication** and **sharing**.

---

## 📌 Why Are Networks Important?

- Enable communication between devices (emails, messages, video calls)
- Share files and data quickly
- Share hardware (like printers or internet connections)
- Access central databases or cloud resources

---

## 🔍 Basic Terminology

- **Node**: Any device connected to a network (e.g., computer, printer)
- **Link**: The communication path between two nodes
- **Router**: Directs data between networks
- **Switch**: Connects devices within the same network
- **Protocol**: Set of rules to transfer data (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP)

## 🏠 LAN (Local Area Network)

### Definition:
A **LAN** is a network that connects computers and devices in a **small geographic area**, such as:
- Home
- Office
- School

### Features:
- High speed (100 Mbps to 10 Gbps)
- Low latency
- Private ownership
- Limited range (typically up to a few hundred meters)

### Example:
> You have 3 laptops, a printer, and a router in your house connected via Wi-Fi. That’s a **LAN**.

---

## 🌆 MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

### Definition:
A **MAN** connects multiple LANs in a **larger geographic area**, typically within a city or large campus.

### Features:
- Medium-to-high speed (often up to 1 Gbps)
- Covers a city or large region
- Usually managed by ISPs or large organizations

### Example:
> A university campus with different buildings each having its own LAN connected together across the city is a **MAN**.

---

## 🌍 WAN (Wide Area Network)

### Definition:
A **WAN** connects multiple LANs and MANs across **long distances**, even globally.

### Features:
- Slower compared to LAN (varies depending on connection)
- Covers large geographical areas (countries, continents)
- Often relies on third-party services (like ISPs)

### Example:
> The Internet is the **biggest WAN** in the world. It connects millions of devices across countries.

## 🛠️ Real-World Examples

- **LAN**: Your home Wi-Fi with smartphones, a smart TV, and a laptop.
- **MAN**: Tehran municipality network connecting all its departments across districts.
- **WAN**: Google’s global data centers communicating over fiber optic cables.

---

## 📚 Extra Concepts (Optional for Deeper Understanding)

- **Intranet**: Private network within an organization (like a company LAN)
- **Extranet**: External users given limited access to internal network
- **VPN**: Virtual Private Network – used to securely connect to a remote network

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Understanding LAN, MAN, and WAN is essential to grasp how computers and systems communicate, from your local devices to global infrastructure.

> All networks start small (LAN) and scale outwards (MAN, WAN) depending on the need for distance and data sharing.
