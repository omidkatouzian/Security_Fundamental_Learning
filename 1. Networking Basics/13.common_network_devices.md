# 🖧 Common Network Devices – Router, Switch, Firewall, Access Point

## 🧠 What Are Network Devices?

**Network devices** are hardware components that connect computers, printers, phones, and other devices so they can communicate and share resources. Each type of device has a unique role in building and managing networks.

## 🔁 Router

### 📍 What It Does:
A **router** connects **multiple networks** together. Most commonly, it connects a home or office network to the **Internet**.

### ⚙️ Key Functions:
- Routes data between devices and external networks
- Assigns IP addresses (often includes a DHCP server)
- Performs NAT (Network Address Translation)
- May include built-in firewall and Wi-Fi

### 🧪 Example:
Your home router connects your Wi-Fi network to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and assigns local IPs to your devices.

## 🔄 Switch

### 📍 What It Does:
A **switch** connects **multiple devices within the same network** (LAN) and forwards data based on **MAC addresses**.

### ⚙️ Key Functions:
- Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**
- Forwards frames only to the intended recipient
- Builds a MAC address table for intelligent forwarding

### 🧪 Example:
An office switch connects 10 computers in a local area network.

## 🔥 Firewall

### 📍 What It Does:
A **firewall** filters **incoming and outgoing traffic** based on predefined security rules. It can be hardware, software, or both.

### ⚙️ Key Functions:
- Blocks unauthorized access
- Protects against malware and attacks
- Controls traffic based on IPs, ports, and protocols
- Can implement rules like "Block all traffic from this country"

### 🧪 Example:
A company firewall blocks access to social media websites during work hours.

## 📡 Access Point (AP)

### 📍 What It Does:
An **access point** allows **wireless devices** to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi.

### ⚙️ Key Functions:
- Extends wireless coverage
- Bridges Wi-Fi traffic to wired LAN
- Often used in large buildings or campuses

### 🧪 Example:
An access point in a hotel lobby allows guests to connect to the Internet wirelessly.

## 🛠 All-in-One Devices

- Many **home routers** act as **router + switch + access point + firewall**.
- In enterprise networks, each function is handled by **dedicated hardware** for performance and security.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Router**: Connects different networks (e.g., LAN to Internet)
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN
- **Firewall**: Protects network traffic with security rules
- **Access Point**: Provides Wi-Fi access to a wired network

> These devices form the **foundation of any network**, from small homes to large enterprises.
