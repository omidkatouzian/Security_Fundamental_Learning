# 🔁 ARP Protocol – Address Resolution Protocol

## 🧠 What is ARP?

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is a communication protocol used to **map an IP address to a MAC address** within a **local network** (LAN).

It helps devices find each other on the same network by resolving IP addresses into physical hardware addresses.

---

## 🔍 Why is ARP Needed?

- IP addresses are logical (Layer 3 – Network Layer).
- MAC addresses are physical (Layer 2 – Data Link Layer).
- Devices use ARP to find the MAC address of the destination when they only know its IP.

## ⚙️ How ARP Works

1. A device wants to send data to another IP, e.g., `192.168.1.5`.
2. It checks its ARP table for the matching MAC.
3. If not found, it **broadcasts an ARP Request**: “Who has 192.168.1.5?”
4. The target device replies with an **ARP Reply**: “192.168.1.5 is at AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF”.
5. The sender stores this in its **ARP table** for future use.

## 📘 Example

You want to ping `192.168.1.10`:

- Your device doesn’t know its MAC.
- Sends: `ARP Request` to the network.
- Gets back: `ARP Reply` → MAC = `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
- Ping is sent to that MAC address.

## 📄 ARP Table

Each device keeps a table of IP-to-MAC mappings.

| IP Address     | MAC Address           |
|----------------|------------------------|
| 192.168.1.1    | 00:11:22:33:44:55      |
| 192.168.1.10   | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E      |

## 🛡️ ARP Spoofing (Security Concern)

**ARP Spoofing** is an attack where a malicious device sends fake ARP replies to trick others into sending data to the wrong MAC.

### 🧨 Effects:
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Data interception
- Network disruption

### 🔒 Protection:
- Use **static ARP entries** for critical systems
- Enable **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** on switches
- Use secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH)

## 🧰 Useful Commands

### On Windows:
```bash
arp -a
```

### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
arp
```

## 🔄 Types of ARP

| Type              | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ARP Request        | Broadcast asking “Who has this IP?”                     |
| ARP Reply          | Unicast reply saying “This IP is at this MAC”           |
| Gratuitous ARP     | A device sends its own ARP info without being asked     |
| Proxy ARP          | A router replies to ARP on behalf of another device     |
| Reverse ARP (RARP) | Maps MAC back to IP (mostly obsolete)                   |

## ✅ Summary

- **ARP** links IP addresses to MAC addresses in a LAN.
- It’s essential for communication within local networks.
- Used every time a device needs to send data to a new IP.
- Must be protected against spoofing to ensure network integrity.

> ARP is like asking, “Where do I deliver this letter?” — and getting the exact street address (MAC) for the known name (IP).
