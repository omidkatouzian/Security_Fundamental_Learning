# 🌐 Subnetting – Splitting a Network into Smaller Parts

## 🧠 What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable **subnetworks (subnets)**.

This allows better use of IP addresses, improves security, and enhances network performance.

---

## 🔍 Why is Subnetting Important?

- **Efficient IP address usage**: Avoids wasting IPs.
- **Improved security**: Limits broadcast traffic to subnets.
- **Easier management**: Divides a network based on departments or functions.
- **Faster performance**: Reduces congestion and collisions.

## 📦 Key Concepts

### 1️⃣ IP Address
- Format (IPv4): `192.168.1.1`
- Two parts:
  - **Network portion**
  - **Host portion**

### 2️⃣ Subnet Mask
- Defines how much of the IP is network vs. host
- Example: `255.255.255.0` = `/24` = First 24 bits are the network

### 3️⃣ CIDR Notation
- Shorthand to write subnet mask
- Format: `192.168.1.0/24`
- `/24` means 24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts

## 🧮 How Subnetting Works

Say you have the network `192.168.1.0/24` and want to divide it into 4 subnets.

- `/24` has 256 IPs (0–255)
- Dividing into 4 subnets = 64 IPs per subnet

| Subnet # | Network Address | First Host   | Last Host    | Broadcast Address |
|----------|------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1        | 192.168.1.0/26   | 192.168.1.1  | 192.168.1.62 | 192.168.1.63      |
| 2        | 192.168.1.64/26  | 192.168.1.65 | 192.168.1.126| 192.168.1.127     |
| 3        | 192.168.1.128/26 | 192.168.1.129| 192.168.1.190| 192.168.1.191     |
| 4        | 192.168.1.192/26 | 192.168.1.193| 192.168.1.254| 192.168.1.255     |

## 🧠 Subnetting Math Basics

### Bitwise Calculation:
- Convert subnet mask to binary to count network/host bits
- Example: `255.255.255.0` = `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000` → `/24`

### Hosts per Subnet:
- Formula: `2^n - 2` (n = host bits)
- Example: `/26` → 6 host bits → `2^6 - 2 = 62 hosts`

### Number of Subnets:
- Formula: `2^n` (n = subnet bits borrowed)
- Example: Going from /24 to /26 → borrowed 2 bits → `2^2 = 4 subnets`

## 🛠️ Tools That Help

- **Subnet calculators** (online or CLI tools)
- **CIDR charts**
- **Binary calculators** (for manual subnetting practice)

## ✅ Real-World Example

A company has the IP block `192.168.10.0/24`. It has 3 departments:

- IT (needs 60 hosts)
- HR (needs 30 hosts)
- Marketing (needs 20 hosts)

By subnetting:

- IT gets `192.168.10.0/26` (64 IPs)
- HR gets `192.168.10.64/27` (32 IPs)
- Marketing gets `192.168.10.96/27` (32 IPs)

Efficient use of IPs with clear separation.

## ✅ Summary

- Subnetting divides a network into smaller pieces.
- It helps manage, secure, and optimize network performance.
- Requires understanding binary and CIDR.
- Essential for **network engineers, system admins, and security professionals**.
