# 🏷️ MAC Address – The Unique ID of a Network Device

## 🧠 What is a MAC Address?

A **MAC Address** (Media Access Control Address) is a **unique identifier** assigned to a network interface card (**NIC**) of a device.

It is used for **device identification** and **communication** on the **local network (LAN)**.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Permanent**: Usually assigned by the device manufacturer and stored in hardware (firmware).
- **Unique**: No two devices should have the same MAC address on a local network.
- **Local scope**: Used only within the same network segment (not over the internet).
- **Layer 2** of the OSI Model: Operates at the Data Link Layer.

---

## 🧮 MAC Address Format

- **48-bit hexadecimal number**
- Written in 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits
- Format: `XX:XX:XX:YY:YY:YY` or `XX-XX-XX-YY-YY-YY`
- Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

### Parts of a MAC Address:

| Part         | Meaning                         |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| XX:XX:XX     | Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) - identifies manufacturer |
| YY:YY:YY     | Device ID assigned by manufacturer |

## 🛠️ MAC Address Example

Let’s say you have a Wi-Fi adapter in your laptop.

- Manufacturer: Intel
- MAC address: `00:1B:44:11:3A:B7`

This is how your router identifies your device locally to assign an IP address.

## 🌐 MAC vs IP Address

| Feature           | MAC Address                       | IP Address                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Layer             | Data Link (Layer 2)                | Network (Layer 3)            |
| Scope             | Local (LAN)                        | Global (Internet/Network)    |
| Format            | Hexadecimal (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C...) | Decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1)  |
| Assigned By       | Manufacturer                       | Network Admin or DHCP        |
| Changeable?       | Hard to change (but possible)      | Easily changeable            |

## 🚦 Real-World Usage of MAC Address

- **DHCP Binding**: Router gives the same IP to a device using its MAC.
- **Access Control**: Routers can **block or allow** devices based on MAC.
- **Network Monitoring**: MACs help identify devices on tools like Wireshark.
- **ARP Protocol**: Resolves IP to MAC on a local network.

---

## 🔐 Security Note

- MAC addresses can be **spoofed** (faked) using software tools.
- Network administrators should not rely solely on MAC for security.

---

## 🧰 How to Find Your MAC Address

### 🪟 On Windows:
```bash
ipconfig /all
```

### 🍎 On macOS/Linux:
```bash
ifconfig
```
or
```bash
ip link show
```

## ✅ Summary

- A **MAC address** uniquely identifies a network device on a **local network**.
- It plays a key role in device communication, routing, and network management.
- It's used in **Layer 2 switching, ARP, DHCP, filtering, and tracking**.

> Think of a MAC address like a **digital fingerprint** for your network device.
