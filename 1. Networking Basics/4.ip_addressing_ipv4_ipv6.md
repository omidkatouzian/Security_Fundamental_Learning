# 🌐 IP Addressing (IPv4 / IPv6)

## 🧠 What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a **unique identifier** assigned to each device on a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

It works like a **home address** for your device, so data knows where to go and where it came from.

## 📦 Why Are IP Addresses Important?

- They **identify devices** on a network.
- Help **route data** across the internet.
- Allow communication between devices across different locations.

## 🧮 IPv4 – Internet Protocol version 4

### 🔹 Structure:
- 32-bit address
- Written in **decimal** format
- Divided into **4 octets** (each from 0 to 255)
- Format: `A.B.C.D` → Example: `192.168.1.1`

### 🔹 Address Space:
- Supports about **4.3 billion** addresses (2³²)
- Due to demand, IPv4 addresses are running out

### 🔹 Types:
- **Public IP**: Routable over the internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8)
- **Private IP**: Used in local networks (e.g., 192.168.0.1)
- **Static IP**: Does not change
- **Dynamic IP**: Assigned by DHCP and can change

### 🔹 Reserved Ranges (Private IPs):
| Class | Range               | CIDR         |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| A     | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 | 10.0.0.0/8  |
| B     | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 | 172.16.0.0/12 |
| C     | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | 192.168.0.0/16 |

## 🆕 IPv6 – Internet Protocol version 6

### 🔹 Structure:
- 128-bit address
- Written in **hexadecimal**
- Format: `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx`
- Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

### 🔹 Address Space:
- Supports **340 undecillion** addresses (2¹²⁸)
- Designed to **solve IPv4 exhaustion**
- More efficient routing and built-in security

### 🔹 Simplification:
- Leading zeros can be omitted
- Continuous zero groups can be compressed with `::`
- Example:
  - Full: `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`
  - Shortened: `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`

## 📊 IPv4 vs IPv6 Comparison

| Feature              | IPv4                          | IPv6                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Address Length       | 32 bits                       | 128 bits                          |
| Format               | Decimal (e.g., 192.0.2.1)     | Hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:db8::1)   |
| Address Space        | ~4.3 billion addresses        | Virtually unlimited               |
| Configuration        | Manual or DHCP                | Auto-configurable                 |
| Security             | Optional (IPSec)              | Mandatory (IPSec built-in)        |
| Speed and Routing    | Slower with more NAT          | Faster and more efficient routing |

## 🛠️ Real-World Example

- When you connect your phone to Wi-Fi, your router assigns it an **IP address** (usually IPv4).
- When you visit a website, your device uses its IP address to send requests, and the server responds to that address.
- Modern websites and networks increasingly support **IPv6** to future-proof connectivity.

---

## 🧠 Key Terms

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP.
- **Subnetting**: Divides a network into smaller, manageable pieces (subnets).
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: A method to represent IP addresses and routing.

---

## ✅ Summary

- IP addresses are essential for communication over the internet.
- **IPv4** is still widely used but limited in space.
- **IPv6** is the future, offering scalability, speed, and security.
- Understanding IP addressing is **fundamental to networking and cybersecurity**.

> Without IP addressing, no data could reach its destination on a network.
